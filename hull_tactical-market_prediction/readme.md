## 🎯 **Overview**

For decades, the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)** has ruled finance — claiming that prices reflect all available information, making it impossible to consistently outperform the market.

But here’s the twist:  
**Data science has changed the game.**
 
With the rise of machine learning, deep feature engineering, and alternative data sources, it’s time to put EMH to the test.  
This competition challenges you to **build a predictive model for excess market returns** — and design a **betting strategy** that can **outperform the S&P 500** under a **120% volatility cap**.

Your task isn’t just to predict prices.  
It’s to challenge a cornerstone of modern finance.

## 🧩 **Your Mission**

**Build a model that:**

1. 📈 Predicts **daily excess returns** based on market and proprietary features.  
2. 🧮 Implements a **position-sizing or exposure-adjustment strategy** that rebalances at each close.  
3. ⚙️ Operates under a **volatility constraint of 120%** relative to the S&P 500.  
4. 🥇 **Outperforms the market** in risk-adjusted terms.

## 🧠 **Why It Matters**

This isn’t just another Kaggle competition.  
Your work could:

- 🔍 Reveal **hidden patterns** in market dynamics  
- 🧬 Demonstrate that **markets aren’t perfectly efficient**  
- 💡 Inspire **new investment strategies** and research  
- 🚀 **Redefine how finance and AI intersect**
