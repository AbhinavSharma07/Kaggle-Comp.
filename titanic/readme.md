# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster  

This repository contains the solution to the Kaggle competition *"Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster"*. The goal of this challenge is to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on features such as age, gender, and socio-economic class.  

## Overview  

### Problem Statement  
Build a predictive model to determine which types of passengers were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster.  

### Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Training set**: Contains features and the target variable (`Survived`), indicating survival.  
- **Test set**: Contains features but no target variable.  
- **Sample submission file**: Example format for submitting predictions.  

### Features  
The dataset includes the following key attributes:  
- PassengerId, Name, Age, Gender  
- Ticket class, Fare, Cabin, Embarked port  
- Survival status (`Survived`)  

### Evaluation Metric  
Submissions are evaluated based on **accuracy**, the percentage of correct survival predictions.  

### Submission Format  
The submission file should be a CSV with the following structure:
