Here's the idea:\n\n1. **Detect Language**: We break the text into words and determine the language of each.\n2. **Calculate Proportion**: We then compute the percentage of English words in the entire text.\n3. **Assign Label**: The text which gets higher percentage of English words is classified as **Real** and its number is saved to the results list.\n\n---\n\n### üì¶ Getting Started: Install & Import Required Packages\n","metadata":{"id":"2-uxElrLnwNy","papermill":{"duration":0.005901,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.769223","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.763322","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"id":"872ab685","cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install langdetect","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.780522Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.780145Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.239898Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.238668Z"},"id":"LCyK5ruYWdAp","outputId":"6e27c50a-b46e-49c3-d7cb-1a7c25ad6af3","papermill":{"duration":8.467807,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.241966","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:09.774159","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting langdetect\r\n","  Downloading langdetect-1.0.9.tar.gz (981 kB)\r\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\u001b[0m \u001b[32m981.5/981.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m12.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\r\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\r\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages (from langdetect) (1.17.0)\r\n","Building wheels for collected packages: langdetect\r\n","  Building wheel for langdetect (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\r\n","  Created wheel for langdetect: filename=langdetect-1.0.9-py3-none-any.whl size=993223 sha256=20d6d2dcb9e60d636ba897b2329505fe1d84d3f1c7ff1646a9424f99da193ee7\r\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/0a/f2/b2/e5ca405801e05eb7c8ed5b3b4bcf1fcabcd6272c167640072e\r\n","Successfully built langdetect\r\n","Installing collected packages: langdetect\r\n","Successfully installed langdetect-1.0.9\r\n"]}],"execution_count":1},{"id":"9d4a1e72","cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom langdetect import detect, DetectorFactory\nfrom langdetect.lang_detect_exception import LangDetectException\nimport unicodedata\n\nimport string\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nimport numpy as np\nDetectorFactory.seed = 42","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.254982Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.254522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.250987Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.250005Z"},"id":"ImkKXISLXN6V","papermill":{"duration":4.005574,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.253245","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:18.247671","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"id":"b7b9ab10","cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n### üìÑ Load the Data\n\nNow, let's load the data into memory for exploration and processing.\n\nWe'll use `Pandas` to read the file into a DataFrame, which allows for easy data manipulation and analysis throughout the notebook.","metadata":{"id":"K9Sj8cJcYooa","papermill":{"duration":0.006209,"end_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.266228","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-06-22T19:14:22.260019","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"id":"f0a81296","cell_type":"code","source":"def read_texts_from_dir(dir_path):\n  \"\"\"\n  Reads the texts from a given directory and saves them in the pd.DataFrame with columns ['id', 'file_1', 'file_2'].\n\n  Params:\n    dir_path (str): path to the directory with data\n  \"\"\"\n  #
