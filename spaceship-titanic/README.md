# Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle Competition  

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are essential to solve a cosmic mystery. This repository contains the solution to the Kaggle competition *"Spaceship Titanic"*. The challenge is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension following a collision with a spacetime anomaly.  

## Overview  

### Problem Statement  
Predict whether passengers on the Spaceship Titanic were transported to an alternate dimension based on records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.  

### Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  
- **Training set**: Includes passenger records and whether they were transported (`Transported` target variable).  
- **Test set**: Includes passenger records but no target variable.  
- **Sample submission file**: Example format for submitting predictions.  

### Evaluation Metric  
Submissions are evaluated based on **classification accuracy**, the percentage of correct labels in the predictions.
