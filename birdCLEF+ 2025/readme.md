# 🌿 Soundscape Species Classification - El Silencio Natural Reserve

This repository contains our solution for the **Bioacoustic Soundscape Species Identification Challenge**, focused on identifying rare and under-studied species from passive acoustic monitoring data in the tropical lowland forests of Colombia's Magdalena Valley.

## 🌍 Overview

**Goal of the Competition**  
Mobile and habitat-diverse species serve as important indicators of biodiversity change. Traditional biodiversity surveys are labor-intensive and costly, but **Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)** provides a scalable and efficient alternative. This competition challenges participants to develop machine learning models that can identify **species by their acoustic signatures**, even with limited labeled data.

By building accurate classifiers using soundscape data, your work contributes to better monitoring of biodiversity trends and restoration progress in the **El Silencio Natural Reserve**, aiding conservation efforts across Colombia’s tropical lowlands.

## 🐸 Competition Objectives

1. **Detect species** from different taxonomic groups using audio data.
2. **Train with limited labeled samples**, especially for rare or endangered species.
3. **Leverage unlabeled data** to improve model accuracy using semi-supervised learning approaches.

## 📍 Context

The **Magdalena Valley** in Colombia is a critical biodiversity hotspot, but it's under threat due to deforestation and livestock farming. The **El Silencio Natural Reserve**, spanning 5,407 acres, serves as a model conservation project where ecological restoration is actively ongoing.

### Why This Matters:
- 🐦 Home to over 295 birds, 69 mammals, 50 reptiles, and 34 amphibians.
- 🌱 Nearly 500 species of plants.
- 🛡️ Restoration here helps combat biodiversity loss and supports climate regulation.

By analyzing soundscape data from this region, your models will help conservationists evaluate ecological health and biodiversity recovery with greater precision and frequency.
