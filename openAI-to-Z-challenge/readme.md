# 🧭 Lost Amazon Legends: A Digital Archaeology Quest

Welcome to our project repository for **"Lost Amazon Legends"**, an open-source AI-powered investigation into the hidden past of the Amazon Basin. This submission is part of the OpenAI archaeology challenge to discover **previously unknown archaeological sites** in the Amazon biome using satellite data, LIDAR, Indigenous knowledge, and AI models like GPT-4.1 and o4-mini.

## 📜 Overview

Stretching across over 6 million square kilometers and 9 countries, the Amazon Rainforest is rich with untold stories. Many believe dense ancient civilizations once flourished beneath its thick canopy, giving rise to legends such as:

- 🗺️ **The Lost City of Z**
- 🪙 **El Dorado**
- 🏛️ **Paititi**

Our mission: **to uncover new, verifiable archaeological sites hidden in the Amazon using open-source remote sensing data, historical texts, and AI-driven tools.**

## 🧪 Project Objectives

1. **🌍 Site Discovery**  
   Identify unknown or poorly documented archaeological sites within the Amazon biome using satellite and LIDAR data.

2. **📍 Verification Pipeline**  
   Validate predictions with **two independent verification methods**, combining:
   - Image pattern analysis (deforestation anomalies, rectilinear structures)
   - Historical document triangulation
   - LIDAR terrain modeling

3. **📚 Historical Insights**  
   Synthesize findings with Indigenous oral histories, colonial diaries, and scholarly research to contextualize the site.

4. **🧠 Methodology Innovation**  
   Develop reproducible pipelines using OpenAI models and open geospatial tools to enable further discoveries.
