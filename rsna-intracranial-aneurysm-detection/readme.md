# Brain Aneurysm Detection

## Overview
Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical in healthcare, especially for potentially life-threatening medical conditions like brain aneurysms. Brain aneurysms (or intracranial aneurysms) are focal dilations in the arteries of the brain that may not show symptoms initially but can be deadly if not diagnosed accurately and treated appropriately.

Experienced radiologists can detect aneurysms on images of the brain, but they can be easily overlooked, particularly when imaging studies are performed for other purposes. Rapid and accurate automated detection of aneurysms on routine brain imaging studies could help prevent devastating outcomes for patients.

## Description
Intracranial aneurysms affect around 3% of the global population. Unfortunately, up to 50% of these aneurysms are only diagnosed after they rupture, which can result in severe illness or death. Worldwide, intracranial aneurysms cause approximately 500,000 deaths each year, and roughly half of the victims are younger than 50.

In this competition, hosted by RSNA with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR), the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS), and the European Society of Neuroradiology (ESNR), you'll create ML models to detect and precisely locate intracranial aneurysms across various types of medical images, including CTA, MRA, and T1 post-contrast and T2-weighted MRI. The challenge includes real clinical variation, with data from different institutions, scanners, and imaging protocols that will test your modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

Your work will pave the way for automated solutions to accurately and efficiently diagnose brain aneurysms across a wide range of brain imaging, which will ultimately save lives by enabling earlier intervention before a catastrophic aneurysm rupture.
