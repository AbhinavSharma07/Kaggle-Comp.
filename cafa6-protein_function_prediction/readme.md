# 🧬 Protein Function Prediction using Amino Acid Sequences

## 📌 Overview

Proteins are fundamental to almost every biological process, from oxygen transport to muscle growth and cellular signaling. Each protein’s **function is determined by its amino acid sequence**, yet the biological roles of many proteins remain unknown.

This repository contains a **machine learning solution to predict protein functions** directly from amino acid sequences by assigning **Gene Ontology (GO) terms**. These predictions can accelerate biological discovery, support experimental prioritization, and contribute to medical and agricultural research.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given a protein’s amino acid sequence, predict its associated **Gene Ontology (GO) terms**, which describe:

* **Molecular Function (MF)** – what the protein does
* **Biological Process (BP)** – processes it participates in
* **Cellular Component (CC)** – where it operates in the cell

This is a **multi-label classification problem** with:

* Highly imbalanced labels
* Noisy and incomplete biological annotations
* Proteins having multiple and context-dependent functions

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

* Learn rich representations from raw protein sequences
* Accurately predict multiple GO terms per protein
* Build a scalable and biologically meaningful ML pipeline
* Support downstream research in protein function discovery

---

## 🧪 Dataset

* **Input**: Protein amino acid sequences
* **Output**: Multiple GO term labels per protein
* **Challenges**:

  * Large label space
  * Sparse annotations
  * Long sequence lengths

*(Dataset details depend on the competition source and are assumed to follow standard GO annotation formats.)*

## 🏗️ Approach

### 1. Sequence Representation

* Raw amino acid sequences
* Tokenization of 20 standard amino acids
* Padding / truncation for batch processing

### 2. Model Architecture

* Deep learning–based sequence models
* Possible components:

  * Embedding layers for amino acids
  * CNN / RNN / Transformer-based encoders
  * Fully connected layers for multi-label prediction

### 3. Training Strategy

* Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy (multi-label)
* Techniques for class imbalance:

  * Label weighting
  * Threshold tuning
* Regularization and validation monitoring

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

* F1-score (macro / micro)
* Precision & Recall
* Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)
