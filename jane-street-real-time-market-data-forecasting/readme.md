# ðŸ§  Jane Street Market Prediction Challenge

Welcome to our repository for the **Jane Street Market Prediction Challenge**, hosted on Kaggle. In this competition, we explore modeling problems using real-world financial market data derived from Jane Streetâ€™s production systems.

## ðŸ“ˆ Overview

Jane Streetâ€™s challenge involves building a model that captures the complexities of modern financial markets. The provided dataset reflects anonymized and obfuscated market features and responders, making this a uniquely realistic â€” and difficult â€” problem.

### Key Challenges:
- **Non-stationary time series**
- **Fat-tailed distributions**
- **Sudden regime shifts**
- **Anonymized features and targets**
- **Human-driven market behaviors**

This competition mirrors the dynamic and adversarial nature of real-world financial environments.
