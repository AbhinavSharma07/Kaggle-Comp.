# Raman Spectroscopy Transfer Learning for Bioprocess Monitoring

## Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict concentrations of glucose, acetate, and magnesium sulfate from Raman spectroscopy data collected across multiple instruments. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful, label-free, and non-destructive method to characterize chemical compositions, widely used in bioprocess monitoring, chemical screening, and quality control.

The challenge addressed here is the variability between Raman devices from different vendors, which causes models trained on one instrumentâ€™s data to struggle when applied to another. This project aims to build models that generalize well across different devices and adapt effectively to a new Raman system with minimal additional data, simulating a real-world transfer learning scenario.

## Dataset

- Over 2,500 Raman spectra collected from **eight different Raman spectrometers**, each from a different vendor.
- All spectra were recorded under consistent experimental conditions: a probe positioned over each well of 96-well plates containing defined mixtures of glucose, acetate, and magnesium sulfate.
- An additional dataset: a single 96-well plate measured on a **new Raman system with a multiplexer**, simulating a new measurement setup.
- Goal: Predict concentrations of **glucose**, **acetate**, and **magnesium sulfate** from Raman spectra obtained on the new device by leveraging models trained on the eight-device dataset.

- Advances the application of Raman spectroscopy as a **Process Analytical Technology (PAT)** tool in bioprocess engineering.
- Supports rapid and accurate **bioprocess monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and chemical engineering** through domain adaptation techniques.
- Based on a peer-reviewed study in applied spectroscopy, serving as a valuable benchmark for transfer learning in spectral data.
