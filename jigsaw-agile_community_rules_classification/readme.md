# ðŸš€ Reddit Comment Moderation Classifier

**Bringing 'Comment Sense' to Reddit Moderation**

Ever had a comment removed on Reddit and wondered *why*? You're not alone! Each subreddit has its own rules, and moderation decisions can sometimes feel mysterious. This project aims to demystify the process by using **machine learning** to predict whether a comment breaks a specific subreddit rule.
