# LLM Classification Finetuning

This repository contains the solution for the **Kaggle Competition** that involves predicting which chatbot responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). The goal is to develop a machine learning model that aligns chatbot responses with human preferences.

## Competition Overview

The competition challenges participants to:
- Predict user preferences between chatbot responses in a given head-to-head comparison.
- Develop models using a dataset of conversations from the Chatbot Arena.
- Optimize for **log loss** as the evaluation metric.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of:
1. **Train set:** Features, model responses, and winner labels.
2. **Test set:** Features and model responses for which predictions are required.
