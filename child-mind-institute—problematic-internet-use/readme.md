# ðŸ“± Predicting Problematic Internet Use from Physical Activity in Youth

This repository contains our solution for the **Problematic Internet Use Prediction Challenge** (Sep 20 â€“ Dec 20, 2024). The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the level of **problematic internet usage** in children and adolescents based on their **physical activity and fitness data**.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

In today's digital age, excessive technology use among youth is increasingly linked to mental health issues like **depression**, **anxiety**, and **isolation**. However, direct assessments of problematic internet use often require professional help, creating barriers in many communities.

This project explores whether **physical activity metrics** can be used as a proxy for detecting early signs of problematic internet usage â€” allowing for **low-cost**, **accessible**, and **early intervention strategies**.
