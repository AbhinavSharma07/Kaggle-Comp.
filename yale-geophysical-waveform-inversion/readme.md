# üåç Full Waveform Inversion Challenge ‚Äì Seismic Imaging with AI + Physics

Welcome to our repository for the **Full Waveform Inversion (FWI)** challenge! This competition tasks participants with estimating subsurface properties‚Äîlike velocity maps‚Äîusing seismic waveform data. Our goal is to enhance seismic imaging by combining physics-based modeling with modern machine learning techniques.

## üìñ Overview

Seismic imaging is critical for energy exploration, carbon storage, natural hazard assessment, and even medical diagnostics. Traditional methods like FWI are powerful but computationally expensive and sensitive to noise. On the other hand, machine learning is fast and scalable but struggles with generalization and requires large datasets.

This challenge bridges the gap: **can we combine physics and machine learning to get the best of both worlds?**

### üîç Problem Statement

Predict accurate **subsurface velocity models** given **seismic waveform data**. Models must balance:
- **Physical realism** (consistency with wave propagation physics)
- **Generalization** (robust to different types of subsurface structures)
- **Efficiency** (scalable and fast to compute)
