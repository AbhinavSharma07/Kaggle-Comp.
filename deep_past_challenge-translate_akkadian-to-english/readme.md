# 🏺 Deep Past Challenge — Old Assyrian to English Translation
    
## 📌 Overview.    
The **Deep Past Challenge** explores whether modern AI can decode **4,000-year-old business records** written in Old Assyrian cuneiform.

This project builds a **neural machine translation (NMT)** system to translate **transliterated Akkadian (Old Assyrian)** into **English**, helping unlock thousands of ancient tablets that remain unread in museum collections.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
- Language: **Old Assyrian (early Akkadian)**
- Script: **Cuneiform (transliterated)**
- Task: **Machine Translation → Akkadian → English**
- Dataset: ~**8,000 translated tablets**
- Challenge:
  - Low-resource language
  - High morphological complexity
  - One word can encode multiple meanings
  - Standard NMT models struggle

--- 

## 🎯 Objective
Build an accurate translation model that:
- Learns from limited parallel data
- Handles complex morphology
- Generalizes to unseen tablets

Success helps recover voices from **10,000+ untranslated Bronze Age texts**.
