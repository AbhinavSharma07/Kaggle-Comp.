# Image Matching Challenge 2024 - Scene Grouping and 3D Reconstruction

This repository contains our solution for the **Third Image Matching Challenge**, focusing on identifying groups of images belonging to the same 3D scene and reconstructing accurate 3D models from messy image collections. The approach combines feature matching, geometric verification, and graph-based clustering to solve the problem.

## Competition Overview
**Goal**: Group images from diverse collections into coherent 3D scenes while discarding outliers (e.g., unrelated photos). Improve Structure from Motion (SfM) robustness for real-world applications.
