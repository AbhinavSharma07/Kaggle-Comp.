## 🔥 Why AidMate?

In times of crisis, access to information can mean the difference between life and death. However:

- Internet access is often disrupted during disasters.
- Multilingual support is limited in remote aid scenarios.
- Privacy is crucial when dealing with sensitive health or safety information.

Gemma 3n's unique architecture makes it ideal for this use case, with real-time multimodal understanding, offline capability, and a small memory footprint suitable for mobile devices.
