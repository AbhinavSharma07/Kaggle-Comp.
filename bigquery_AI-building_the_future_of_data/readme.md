# 🚀 BigQuery AI Challenge – Unstructured Data Intelligence  

## 📌 Overview  
This project was built as part of the **BigQuery AI Challenge**, which encourages participants to go beyond traditional analytics and build groundbreaking solutions using **BigQuery's AI capabilities** — including **Generative AI, Vector Search, and Multimodal features**.  

Companies today sit on massive amounts of **unstructured data** — PDFs, chat logs, screenshots, and recordings — but lack the tools to extract meaningful insights. This project demonstrates how **AI inside BigQuery** can transform such data into **actionable intelligence** with SQL-driven simplicity.  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
The aim of this project is to **prototype real-world solutions** that:  
- Ingest and process unstructured or mixed-format data  
- Enable **semantic search** across large datasets  
- Generate **summaries, insights, and forecasts** directly in BigQuery  
- Combine **structured and unstructured data** for richer analytics

## ⚡ Approaches  

This project explores one or more of the following **BigQuery AI approaches**:  

### 🧠 Approach 1: The AI Architect  
Leverages **Generative AI in SQL and Python (BigFrames)** for:  
- Text generation with `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` & `AI.GENERATE`  
- Forecasting with `AI.FORECAST`  
- Summarization of raw support call logs into actionable insights  

💡 *Example Use Case:* Executive dashboards that automatically summarize thousands of support tickets into business-ready insights.  

---

### 🕵️‍♀️ Approach 2: The Semantic Detective  
Uses **Vector Search** for semantic understanding:  
- `ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` for text embeddings  
- `VECTOR_SEARCH` with or without a vector index  
- Intelligent retrieval of similar records/documents  

💡 *Example Use Case:* Smart ticket triage bot that finds similar historical support issues and suggests the best resolution.  

---

### 🖼️ Approach 3: The Multimodal Pioneer  
Combines **structured + unstructured data**:  
- Object Tables for unstructured files (PDFs, images, etc.)  
- `ObjectRef` for passing unstructured data to AI models  
- Multimodal BigFrames for fusion of text, tables, and media  

💡 *Example Use Case:* Real estate valuation system that enhances predictions by combining structured attributes (sqft, # of rooms) with property images.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **BigQuery AI** (Generative AI, Vector Search, Multimodal)  
- **SQL Functions** (`AI.GENERATE`, `AI.FORECAST`, `VECTOR_SEARCH`, etc.)  
- **BigFrames (Python)** for AI-powered workflows  
- **Google Cloud Storage** for unstructured data (PDFs, images, logs)
