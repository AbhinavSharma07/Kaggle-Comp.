# ðŸ§  MAP: Misconception Annotation Project

This repository contains our solution for the [Misconception Annotation Project (MAP)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/map-2025) competition. The challenge is to build an NLP model using machine learning to predict potential math misconceptions in student explanations. The ultimate goal is to help teachers diagnose and address studentsâ€™ conceptual misunderstandings more effectively.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

In this competition, participants are asked to:
- Analyze student-written math explanations.
- Predict a set of potential **misconceptions** (tags) that the explanation may reveal.
- Build a model that generalizes well across different types of math problems and misconceptions.

Example:
> **Student Explanation:** "0.355 is bigger than 0.8 because 355 > 8"  
> **Predicted Misconception:** Misunderstanding of place value in decimals.

This work helps automate the detection of common math reasoning errors and could significantly support personalized learning at scale.
