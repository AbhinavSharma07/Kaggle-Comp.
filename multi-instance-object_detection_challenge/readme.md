# 🥫 Multi-Instance Object Detection Challenge (Sim2Real using Synthetic Data)

Welcome to my solution for the **Synthetic-to-Real Object Detection Challenge** hosted by Duality AI and powered by FalconCloud 🌐.

This repository showcases the process of generating synthetic data, training a YOLOv8 model, and detecting **multiple instances of soup cans** in real-world images – all using simulation data only.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

The challenge is to train an object detection model **entirely on synthetic images**, generated using Duality AI's FalconCloud platform, and then **test its performance on real-world images**.

Key Challenge Highlights:

- Train on **synthetic data** only
- Detect **multiple soup cans** per image
- Generate data by modifying parameters in a **digital twin simulation**
- Evaluate performance using **mAP@50**
