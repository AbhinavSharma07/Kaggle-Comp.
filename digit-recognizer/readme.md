# MNIST Digit Recognizer

This repository contains solutions for the **MNIST Digit Classification** task, inspired by Kaggle's classic competition. The objective is to correctly identify handwritten digits from tens of thousands of labeled images.

## About the Dataset
The **MNIST** dataset is a benchmark dataset in computer vision, containing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels and labeled with the corresponding digit. Since its release in 1999, MNIST has been widely used for evaluating classification algorithms and learning techniques.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to experiment with different machine learning algorithms to classify handwritten digits accurately. This serves as a great learning opportunity to understand:
- Regression techniques
- Neural networks
- Comparison of various ML algorithms
