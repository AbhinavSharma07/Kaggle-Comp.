# Oral Disease Classification Task 
 
## Objective
This project aims to develop a machine learning classification model capable of identifying various oral diseases from single-image inputs. The task utilizes image preprocessing, deep learning models, and multiclass classification techniques.

## Key Features
1. **Multiclass Classification**
   - The model predicts a single disease class (e.g., healthy, dental caries, gingivitis, etc.) for each image.
   - Outputs probabilities for each class.

2. **Handling Variations**
   - Effectively handles variations in image quality, lighting conditions, and orientations.
   - Designed to generalize across diverse demographics, including different age groups and genders.

3. **Dataset**
   - Utilizes the provided dataset: [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ptnehBD0JCSCcw0fFzWi9WKAvqV3oBkT/view?usp=drive_link)
