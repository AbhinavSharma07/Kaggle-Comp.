# Melting Point Prediction Challenge
      
## ðŸ§ª Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that predict the melting point (Â°C) of organic compounds using molecular descriptors. Melting point is a critical property in chemistry, impacting drug design, material selection, and process safety. However, obtaining experimental melting point data is often expensive, time-consuming, or not always feasible.

In this challenge, youâ€™ll leverage group contribution featuresâ€”subgroup counts that represent functional groups within each moleculeâ€”to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between molecular structure and melting behavior.

The performance of models is evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** on a held-out test set. The lower the MAE, the better the modelâ€™s predictions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Total compounds**: 3,328  
- **Training set**: 2,662 samples (80%)  
- **Test set**: 666 samples (20%)  
 
### Files:
- `train.csv` : Includes features and target (melting point, `Tm`)
- `test.csv` : Contains features only, without target
- `sample_submission.csv` : Template submission file with columns `id` and `Tm`

### Columns:
- `id` : Unique identifier for each sample
- `SMILES` : Simplified molecular-input line-entry system string representation of the molecule
- `Group 1..N` : Descriptor features representing functional groups within the molecule
- `Tm` : Melting point in Kelvin (only in the training set)
