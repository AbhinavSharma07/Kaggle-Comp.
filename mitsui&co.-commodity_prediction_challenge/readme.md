## üéØ The Challenge: Aiming for More Accurate Commodity Price Forecasting
This competition tackles the critical need for more accurate and stable long-term commodity price predictions. Getting these predictions right has significant implications for both businesses and the global economy. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to suboptimal trading strategies, poor investment decisions, and increased financial risk for companies involved in commodity markets. By encouraging the development of advanced AI models that can accurately predict future commodity returns using historical data from LME, JPX, US Stock, and Forex, this competition aims to directly improve the precision of financial forecasting and enable the optimization of automated trading strategies.

In particular, participants are challenged to predict price-difference series‚Äîderived from the time-series differences between two distinct assets‚Äô prices‚Äîto extract robust price-movement signals as features and deploy AI-driven trading techniques that turn those signals into sustainable trading profits.

## üåç Why It's Important: Stable Markets and Smarter Decisions
Accurate commodity price prediction is crucial for reducing financial risk and ensuring stability in the global market. Currently, the inherent volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices create several problems. Companies struggle with resource allocation, budgeting, and investment planning, often resulting in financial losses and inefficient operations. Inaccurate forecasts can also contribute to market instability and price fluctuations, negatively impacting producers, consumers, and investors alike. If this problem could be solved, businesses could optimize their trading strategies, make more informed investment decisions, and manage risk more effectively. This would lead to more efficient resource allocation, reduced price volatility, and a more stable and predictable global commodity market.

## üöÄ Current Limitations and What We Hope to Achieve
Advanced AI algorithms and high-precision models are currently employed for commodity market prediction, utilizing historical price datasets from LME, JPX, US Stock, and Forex. While these models show promise, they often encounter limitations in consistently achieving high accuracy across diverse market conditions and over extended time horizons. Existing models may exhibit over-reliance on specific data patterns, lacking the adaptability required to navigate the dynamic and constantly evolving nature of financial markets. This competition seeks a more diverse and robust set of algorithms to achieve reliable and stable long-term predictions.
