# 2025 Kaggle Playground Series - July: Personality Type Prediction

Welcome to my solution repository for the **July 2025 Kaggle Playground Series** competition! This month's challenge is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is an **Introvert** or **Extrovert**, based on their social behavior and personality traits.

## 🧠 Problem Overview

The goal of the competition is to classify individuals as **Introvert** or **Extrovert** using provided features that describe personality and behavioral characteristics. The dataset is designed to be approachable for both beginners and experienced data scientists.

This is part of a continuing series of monthly challenges hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), offering an opportunity to learn, practice, and compete.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset includes both training and test sets with a range of anonymized features. The target variable is:

- `Personality`: A binary variable where:
  - `0` = Introvert
  - `1` = Extrovert

Sample features may include:
- Social engagement scores
- Decision-making tendencies
- Response patterns in different situations
- and other personality-based traits
